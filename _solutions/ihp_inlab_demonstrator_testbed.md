description: The in-lab demonstrator provides a controlled environment for simulating, testing, and evaluating energy management strategies and grid resilience algorithms, emulating a hierarchical energy infrastructure with primary and secondary substations, prosumer units, and transmission lines. It enables realistic load generation and measurement (lower voltages for operator safety). The emulator supports a range of customizable grid topologies, allowing project partners to replicate real-world scenarios, such as power outages and varying user behaviours, without risk. It is a cost-effective and safe way to advance grid resilience through repeatable and controlled experiments.
