description: The household simulator allows to simulate the consumption and production patterns of electricity in virtual households by modelling virtual devices and residents. The resident schedule imitates daily routines. It can be used to test energy management algorithms through providing an environment for interaction between the algorithms and smart devices. The custom modelling language supports specifying metadata for households, residents, and devices, setting device usage schedules, and defining device characteristics. It also supports mathematical expressions, variables, and interaction points, allowing for detailed control over device behaviours. The schedule supports introducing variability and randomness in device usage. This approach enables simulation of real-world usage patterns. Provided API allows real-time changes to simulation parameters, fetching information on households and devices, triggering off-schedule tasks, and creating custom drivers.
