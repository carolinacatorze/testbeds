description: Effective energy data management and sharing is crucial for advancing energy efficiency and fostering sustainable practices. Traditionally, data management platforms, notably for smart meters, have been advocated by Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and/or Transmission System Operators (TSOs). DSOs are progressively incorporating data on innovative services, extending beyond smart meter data to include customer data management and collaborative data sharing with TSOs. However, the prerequisite for explicit consent from consumers (data owners) to share their data with third-party service providers presents challenges, potentially disrupting various use cases and business models. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when dealing with behind-the-meter data, as barriers related to connectivity, data privacy, and security hinder seamless access. The challenges persist even when access to data is granted, engaging directly with end-users—consumers— is an ongoing challenge. This lack of direct engagement hampers essential activities like service design, co-creation, and the testing of AI-based solutions tailored to the specific needs and preferences of consumers. By addressing these limitations, the energy sector can unlock the full potential of AI for the benefit of both consumers and the broader energy community. To advance the development and validation of energy data sharing use cases in real-world settings, alongside the design of citizen-centric digital services and technologies at the local community level, INESC TEC partnered with Cooperativa Eléctrica do Vale d’Este, an energy cooperative acting as a local DSO and retailer. Together, they deployed a comprehensive range of monitoring equipment including total and individual energy meters, smart plugs, ambient temperature, and humidity sensors across dozens of households with PV, electric vehicles, heat pumps, electrical water heaters, among others. The unique feature of this initiative is the use of Data Space and semantic interoperability technology, particularly the open-source Data Space building blocks. In this community setting, these tools facilitate a wide array of energy and cross-sector services, fostering innovative consumer and community-centric business models. Furthermore, they ensure critical principles such as privacy, confidentiality, cybersecurity, sovereignty, and granting users full control over their data.
concept: The IN-DATA facilitates access to a local Energy Data Space, enabling AI-based energy service providers to collaborate and develop their solutions within a co-creation environment alongside consumers and prosumers. This space empowers users to collectively manage, share, and safeguard their personal data rights and usage in alignment with the EU Data Governance Act principles. Furthermore, it establishes an integrated data ecosystem, encompassing both real-time and historical data, while engaging citizens to drive the emergence of innovative data-centric services. These services aim to inspire shifts in consumer behavior, promote adopting new DER solutions, and foster business models that contribute to achieving net-zero objectives in the local energy system. This test bed is also a node of a Testing and Experimentation Facility (TEF) of the Horizon Europe project AI-EFFECT (“Artificial Intelligence Experimentation Facility For the Energy seCTor”, Grant Agreement no. 101069831). Potential use cases are 1) Test generative AI or differential privacy techniques for encouraging data sharing by creating synthetic datasets with minimal expert input. 2) Test peer-to-peer trading and energy-sharing mechanisms infused with AI technologies that can adapt and optimize strategies over time. 3) Test AI-based recommenders tailored to improve energy efficiency, e.g., enable contextually relevant and highly personalized recommendations to individual consumers or analyze energy consumption patterns at the household and community levels to identify opportunities for demand response and energy conservation initiatives. 4) State estimation, congestion, and voltage management in low voltage grids with a high penetration of distributed energy resources (e.g., photovoltaic, electric vehicles). 5) Control and optimization of behind-the-meter storage. However, other use cases can be proposed by start-ups, SMEs, or large companies interested in testing their AI-based solutions for prosumers, local energy communities, and low-voltage grids.
technology: The IN-DATA architecture is designed for efficient data collection, processing, storage, and monitoring using various integrated technologies. Shelly Devices gathers environmental data, which is managed and processed by Python scripts. Once the data is collected, it is sent to RabbitMQ, a message broker that facilitates the exchange of data between different components of the system. The processed data is then stored in a non-relational database within the Sentinel bases. The architecture also includes DjangoFramework, MySQL, and Vue. DjangoFramework serves as an API layer, providing data to the front end, which is built with Vue. MySQL acts as a traditional database backend, storing structured data. Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment and scaling of these components. Cassandra within Sentinel handles specific data types, ensuring high scalability and resilience. Access to the data is managed through the dataspace, ensuring seamless integration and efficient data management.
hardware: Forty homes are equipped with temperature, humidity, and energy meters with real-time communication. The homes have different assets, such as heat pumps (≥ 6), thermoelectric water heaters (≥5), electric vehicles (≥3), PV (at least five homes), and behind-the-meter battery storage (≥2). It comprises different typologies of residencies and citizens from different social backgrounds. Currently, there are 9 months of historical data of different temporal resolutions (e.g., with a minimum granularity of 1 min), namely active power consumption/generation, indoor temperature, and humidity.
software: A Data Space using the open-source components from the Horizon Europe ENERSHARE project (“European commoN EneRgy dataSpace framework enabling data sHaring-driven Across- and beyond-eneRgy sErvices”, Grant Agreement no. 101069831), namely the TSG Metadata broker, TSG Connector, Dynamic Attribute Provisioning Service, is operational. A dashboard for the consumers was developed for energy consumption visualization and analytics. The user interface uses Vue, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, creating a responsive and maintainable front end. Vue provides a dynamic, component-based framework for building interactive UI elements. Tailwind CSS offers utility-first styling, ensuring consistency and responsiveness across devices. TypeScript adds type safety and improves code quality by catching errors early. This combination ensures a robust, visually appealing, and efficient UI capable of handling real-time data visualization and user interaction seamlessly.
