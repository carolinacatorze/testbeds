description: B5G/6G L-GRECO platform [Athens, Greece], is a state-of-the-art large-scale testbed supporting 5G SA and B5G networks, cloud and edge infrastructures, IoT systems and AI applications. Located in Athens, the testbed expands across the campuses of NCSR Demokritos and OTE Academy that are interconnected through a dedicated 10G dark fiber, and hosts multiple physical and virtualized resources capable to support various simultaneous demands. It integrates orchestrators capable to support ad-hoc instantiation of tailored trial networks and automated life-cycle management and execution of large-scale experiments on top of these networks.  Both enterprise-grade and open/experimental 5G cores are operated, with an assortment of mid-band and high-band radio access networks including satellite backhauling capabilities, thus offering the opportunity to study complex cases.  A satellite/NTN emulator, is also integrated and enables low-cost, agile multi-operator and multi-access situations. The combination of all above components introduces multi-connectivity scenarios, to study how traffic is handled across different network connections, as well as over different administrative domains of the IoT-Edge-Cloud continuum.

concept: The concept is to provide a platform combining physical and virtual resources which can be orchestrated as a whole and be exposed to an experimentation methodology which by defining trial networks topologies can support the execution of a variety of user defined test cases. The details of each test case define the exact scenarios and network slices, which are deployed for the acquisition of a certain set of KPIs and KVIs which are used to evaluate networks behavior and equipment efficiency.
