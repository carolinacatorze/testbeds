use-cases: Installing solar panels at a user's own home and connecting them to inverters with the purpose of becoming a prosumer, then being able to visualise in real time the power generation capabilities of each solar panel, so the user can determine their efficiency and ask for maintenance from the PV cell provider, in case of faulty functionality. Additionally, Solar Edge operators will have access to a dashboard of each user's PV cell "garden" and see their phyisical locations mapped geographically, along with their orientation and energy generation capabilities. Warnings and alerts can be generated by specifying certain parameters (the power generation falls under a certain threshold).

description: We are already seeing the large scale implementation of Photovoltaic cell implementation in suburban areas where single-family housing is the norm. A unified way of visualising the energy production in real time is an ideal step forward. The application can provide a histogram of energy generation, so the users can determine which PV cells are more efficient and what during which months there will be no need to draw energy from the electric grid
