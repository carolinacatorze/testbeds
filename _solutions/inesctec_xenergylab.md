description: The X-Energy lab is an experimental test and validation facility focused on SmartGrids and Electric Vehicles integration. This facility hosts a set of capabilities enabling advanced studies combining physical and virtual assets. At its core, resides a physical low-voltage microgrid integrating renewable generation, energy storage, EV charging and miscellaneous domestic appliances, and a real-time digital simulation setup supporting Software-in-the-Loop (SIL), Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) capabilities. Among other applications, the existing assets support the development, test and experimental validation of innovative AI-based algorithms using digital-twins and IoT. The existing domestic appliances and in-the-house made prototypes and commercial solutions for EV chargers and distributed energy resources, allied to important advances in interoperability studies enables the exploitation of IoT concepts, can be used for this end. By other hand, the real-time digital simulation platform with SIL/HIL/PHIL capabilities enables the exploitation of the Digital-Twins concept to this end as well.

concept: The X-Energy lab – SmartGrids and Electric Vehicles laboratory – aims to provide an experimental testing environment for AI-based innovations, combining physical and virtually represented assets. The focus is the experimental test and validation of AI-based solutions applied to the energy sector. The existing real-time digital simulation platform with SIL/HIL/PHIL capabilities enables the development, experimental validation and use of Digital-Twins of the most varied physical assets, ranging from small, distributed energy resources to large power systems. Such Digital-Twins can be based in analytical and/or AI based elements. The support for SIL/HIL/PHIL would allow the interaction of the developed Digital-Twins with the physical world, namely the existing domestic appliances and IoT devices in general, in-the-house made prototypes and commercial solutions for EV chargers and distributed energy resources, loads, and more broadly, the low-voltage microgrid existing in our facilities. Among many possibilities, the proposed experimental environment aims to Validate AI-based solutions for - Energy sector addressing pressing needs such as EV charging management and control; management of distributed energy resources, Interoperability for IoT devices and intelligent distributed energy resources aiming demand-side response; operation of energy communities. - Digital-Twins, from intelligent distributed energy resources up to large power systems. - Grid studies dynamic and transient studies, grid planning, grid resilience and black-start - Preventive fault detection in PV power plants and other assets - Automation and grid protections, for distribution and transmission power grids.
