## AIOTI Testbeds Portfolio

The focus of the **[AIOTI](https://aioti.eu) [WG Testing and Experimentation Environments](https://aioti.eu/about-us/our-groups/testbeds/)** is to provide a set of testbed descriptions based on a specific format to contribute to a coordinated view on testbeds derived from content provided by AIOTI community.

The main goal of the catalogue is to act as a dissemination tool for other AIOTI groups, particularly vertical ones, and to assist in the development of joint work in use-case demonstration and new testbed development.

Reference deliverables of the group can be found in AIOTI [here](https://aioti.eu/resources/testbeds-resources/)

## AIOTI Members - How to Contribute
1. copy the sample.md file to _solutions.
2. rename the _solutions/sample.md to the name of your platform with the format provider_testbedacronym.md
3. fill in all the meta-data (see meta-data of the AIOTI Testbeds Catalogue)
4. Ensure you follow markdown rules, e.g., in text avoid the character ':' (recognized as a separator field) and also isolated '-'.
