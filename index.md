## AIOTI Testbeds Portfolio

The focus of the **WG Testing and Experimentation Environments of [AIOTI](aioti.eu)** is to provide a set of testbed descriptions based on a specific format and aim to contribute to a coordinated view on testbeds derived from content provided by AIOTI partners; the use-cases being developed; the European competitiveness domains being addressed; global perspective on the interest of partners in terms of testbeds.

The main goal of the catalogue is to act as a dissemination tool for other AIOTI groups and to assist in the development of coordinated efforts, such as use-case demonstrations and new testbed development.
